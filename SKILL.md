# Writing Concisely

## Core Principles

1. **Information Density**: Pack maximum meaning into minimum words. Every sentence should carry weight.
2. **Precision First**: Choose exact words over approximate phrases. One precise term beats three vague ones.
3. **Active Construction**: Write in active voice with strong verbs. Avoid weak verb+noun combinations.
4. **No Redundancy**: Avoid repeating the same information in different words. Use one strong example instead of multiple weak ones.

## Writing Techniques

### Primary Techniques

1. **Dense Lists**: Use compound subjects and comma-separated phrases instead of multiple items

   - Write: "TypeScript/JavaScript/JSX support"
   - Not: "Support for TypeScript, support for JavaScript, and support for JSX"

2. **Direct Expression**: State ideas once, clearly

   - Avoid restating concepts in different words
   - Skip filler phrases ("it should be noted that", "it is important to understand")
   - Use one strong example instead of multiple weak ones

3. **Concise Syntax**: Build lean sentences
   - Active voice over passive
   - Gerunds/infinitives over noun phrases
   - Strong verbs over verb+adverb pairs
   - "to" not "in order to", "because" not "due to the fact that"

### Advanced Techniques

4. **Verb-First**: Use verbs directly instead of noun forms

   - "decide" not "make a decision"
   - "analyze" not "perform an analysis"
   - "consider" not "give consideration to"

5. **Strategic Acronyms**: Define acronyms for terms appearing 3+ times

   - "Don't Repeat Yourself" -> "DRY"
   - "You Aren't Gonna Need It" -> "YAGNI"
   - "Keep It Simple Stupid" -> "KISS"

6. **Structural Efficiency**: Minimize transitional overhead

   - Merge related ideas into single paragraphs
   - Use parenthetical clarifications instead of separate sentences
   - Employ punctuation (colons, dashes, semicolons) to combine thoughts

7. **Exact Vocabulary**: Replace phrases with precise single words

   - "now" not "at this point in time"
   - "many" not "a large number of"
   - "if" not "in the event that"

8. **Lean Formatting**: Use minimal markdown that preserves meaning

   - Concise headers
   - Combined code blocks for related concepts
   - Tables for comparisons instead of prose

9. **Consolidated Examples**: One comprehensive example beats multiple similar ones
